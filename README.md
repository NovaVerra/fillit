# fillit

LIBFT is the first project for School 42 in which you build your very own library of functions that prove to be extremely useful and mandatory for upcoming projects.

## Objective

Fillit is a project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring
problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.
A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to
the popular game Tetris.

## Usage

```C
$ make
$ ./fillit [tetris_map]
```
